## üèÜ Achievement

Secured **Silver Medal (2nd place)** out of 10+ teams across IITs and NITs in the Optimization Challenge, demonstrating exceptional problem-solving skills and innovative optimization strategies.

## üìà Project Overview

This repository contains my solution to the [Optimization Challenge](https://github.com/abhijitd1267/Optimization_challenge_exergy25.git), focusing on:
- Advanced circuit parameter fitting using non-linear regression and neural networks
- Accurate modeling of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data for bio-recognition and sensor applications
- Achieved a circuit fitting metric R¬≤ score of **0.984**, significantly im
proving EIS data fitting accuracy
